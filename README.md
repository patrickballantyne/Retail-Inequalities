## Retail centres and COVID-19: Functional and structural inequalities in the response to Omicron.
Patrick Ballantyne, Alex Singleton and Les Dolega

This repo contains all the code used for the paper: Retail centres and COVID-19: Functional, structural and spatial responses to Omicron.

The paper has three aims:

1. Investigate the general response of retail centre activity during the Omicron variant.
2. Explore the extent to which these responses can be explained by the overall *function* of a retail centre.
3. Consider the role of the *structural* and catchment characteristics of retail centres in determining their response to the Omicron variant.

## Data

The primary dataset used in this project is the *Geolytix aggregated in-app location dataset*, which is available via the CDRC; more information can be found [HERE](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/geolytix-aggregated-app-location-dataset).

We integrate the mobility dataset with the CDRC retail centres data product, specifically the boundaries and accompanying indicators, which can be found [HERE](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/retail-centre-boundaries-and-open-indicators). 

Specifically, we examine trends in retail centre activity, calculated as below in the figure.
