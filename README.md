## Retail centres and COVID-19: Functional and structural inequalities in the response to Omicron.
Patrick Ballantyne, Alex Singleton and Les Dolega

This repo contains all the code used for the paper: Retail centres and COVID-19: Functional and structural inequalities in the response to Omicron. 

The paper has three aims:

1. Investigate the general changes to retail centre activity during Omicron, using a high resolution spatio-temporal mobility dataset.
2. Explore the extent to which these responses differed between different types (and functions) of retail centres.
3. Consider the extent to which these responses can be explained by the structural and catchment characteristics of the retail centres.

## Data

The primary dataset used in this project is the *Geolytix aggregated in-app location dataset*, which is available via the CDRC; more information can be found [HERE](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/geolytix-aggregated-app-location-dataset).

We have integrated the mobility dataset with the CDRC retail centres data product, specifically the boundaries and accompanying indicators, which can be found [HERE](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/retail-centre-boundaries-and-open-indicators).
