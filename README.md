# Retail-Inequalities

## Evidence of functional, structural and spatial inequalities in the response of British retail centres to the Omicron variant.

This repo contains all the code used for the paper: Evidence of functional, structural and spatial inequalities in the response of British retail centres to the Omicron variant. The paper has three aims:

1. Investigate the general response of retail centres to the Omicron variant, using a high resolution spatio-temporal mobility dataset.
2. Explore the extent to which these responses differ between retail centres with contrasting functions.
3. Consider the extent to which these responses can be explained by the structural/neighbourhood characteristics of the retail centres.
